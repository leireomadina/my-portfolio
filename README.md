# Leire's Portfolio

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
Keep in mind that the current version is a MVP. This means that the project is actively a work in progress, with continuous improvements and refinements underway. Stay tuned for updates and new features.ðŸ‘€

## ðŸš€ Tech - Astro

This project was crafted using [Astro](https://astro.build/), a web framework designed for building content-driven websites. I chose it for the following reasons:
- Simplicity: based on HTML, CSS and JavaScript/TypeScript.
- Flexibility: component-based architecture and integration with JS frameworks like Vue or React for high interactive components (islands architecture). This facilitates reusability and project scalability.
- Server-first and zero JS by default: fast loading times and better user experience.
- Great SEO, ideal for a portfolio.

Astro has proven to be a remarkable discovery, and the development experience has been very enjoyable overall.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project using the terminal:
